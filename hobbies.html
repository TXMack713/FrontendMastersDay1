    <h2>Some Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Learning to develop software has been a fun and exciting, but also a challenging journey. It has been an adventure that I've been grateful to have had the chance to start down, no matter how late in life I feel like it took me to get started. I'm so grateful for a loving and supportive wife who's been amazing in supporting me on this adventure and making this possible to do.</p>
    <p>I love you babe!</p>
