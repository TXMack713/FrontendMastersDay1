    <h3>How to Make a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab 2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>Grab a jar of peanut butter</li>
        <li>Grab a jar of jelly</li>
        <li>Grab a butter knife, but remember safety first!</li>
        <li>Open both jars</li>
        <li>With the knife in hand, scoop a medium amount of peanut butter from the jar (more if you're a peanut butter fanatic) and spread it onto 1 of the slices of bread, taking care to cover the full side-up slice with the peanut butter</li>
        <li>Next, scoop a medium amount of jelly from the jar (more if it suits you) and spread it onto the 2nd slice of bread, taking care to cover the full side-up slice with the jelly</li>
        <li>Grab both slices of bread and bring them together so that the content-side of each slice mates to each other while also being perfectly aligned</li>
        <li>Finally, enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
